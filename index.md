# About

We explore the affective characteristics and possibilities of technologies across the variegated temporal and geo-political landscapes of the 21st century, and how they are intimately entwined in our everyday lives.

# Events

_Archipelago: Mapping the Moving World_, a gathering in Helsinki, Finland, on August 21-25, 2019. We will convene activists, artists, technologists, and social researchers to share their work and collaborate to investigate the future of human movement.
