# About

We explore the affective characteristics and possibilities of technologies across the variegated temporal and geo-political landscapes of the 21st century, and how they are intimately entwined in our everyday lives. The geopolitical pull of modernization continues, situating information communication technologies as a signifier of “progress” and “civilization.” Technology designers and engineers are rewarded lavishly. Why, then, are many of the most promising engineers turning away, however tentatively? What are they being asked to do, and what do they know needs to be done? How are they affected, and who does their work affect? What actions are possible from outside, and what from within? This group is engaging in projects including a gathering of “disaffected technologists.” 

A disaffection implies the capacity for affect, for an intimacy and erotics of technological production and reception. Throughout the year, gatherings of disaffected technologists, and affected publics, will consider the social consequences of technological production and the avenues for collective positive action.

# Events

_Archipelago: Mapping the Moving World_, a gathering in Helsinki, Finland, on August 21-25, 2019. We will convene activists, artists, technologists, and social researchers to share their work and collaborate to investigate the future of human movement. Together we will investigate the realities and frictions of geographic mobility and social mobility—how flows of people intertwine with flows of information, and how we can mobilize to shape these flows.

This gathering will invite each participant to share their individual work and to pursue collaborative projects under the umbrella of the Archipelago project. The event will offer exercises in collective thinking, workshops for directed action, and an opening to creating installations and interventions. We will explore plans for future events, including collaborative research and action.

The event will take place at Tiedelkulma (University of Helsinki), Aalto University, and Oodi (Helsinki Public Library), and will be hosted by CAD+SR (http://centerartsdesign.org/about), Aalto University, and the University of Helsinki. This event is the first in a planned year-long series of events.
